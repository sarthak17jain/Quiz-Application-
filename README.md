C++ text file handling 
This is a quiz application which uses a text file as a database and picks up random questions from it and displays it on the users screen.
It has also keeps the track of the users score.
It also features multiplayer mode wherein multiple players can compete with each other and the winner of the quiz will be declared. 
I made this project using turboc++ in my class 12th.
