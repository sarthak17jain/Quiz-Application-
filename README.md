C++ text file handling 

This is a quiz application which uses a text file as a database and picks up random questions from it and displays it on the users screen.
Features:
>Keeps the track of the users score.
>Multiplayer mode wherein multiple players can compete with each other and the winner of the quiz will be declared. 
>Admin mode wherein the admin can insert or delete questions in the text file directly from console window.
I made this project using TurboC++ in my class 12th.
